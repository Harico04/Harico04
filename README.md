## Some of the projects I've worked on:

### Van der Waals gas simulation 

Made in Java, it is a GUI project made in my sophomore year in college. It simulates a gas enclosed within a piston with it's corresponding thermodinamyc variables. The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Harico04/Simulacion-de-gas-de-Van-der-Waals)

### Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

Made in c++, it is an application to play the game of Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe. It was made in my freshman year, using the SFML library. The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/AleSanchezB/Ultimate-tic-tac-toe)
